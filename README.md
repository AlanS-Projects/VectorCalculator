# VectorMain.c
A command-line program developed in C to perform vector operations in 2D and 3D. Users can define multiple vectors and calculate dot products, cross products, angles, magnitudes, projections, and unit vectors (up to a limit of 32). Designed as a frist year civil engineering student to help with maths works. 3D is included as long as you set the z componet as 0. 

# Engineering Vector Tool (engineer.c)
A CLI C program for engineering vector calculations. It can calculate moments about an axis, resultant moments from multiple forces, and vector magnitudes.
- Moment about axis: M = (r × F) · λ
- Multiple force vectors handling
- Magnitude and directional calculations

suggestions are welcomed

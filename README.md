# VectorCalculator
My Vector calculator
Currently the user is able to to create as many 3D vectors as much as they want, with a cap of 32.
It can do cross product, dot product, angles between vectors, projection vectors (A_onto_B) and calcualtions of Unit vectors.
Made this during my first year of University engineering
This code was part of a main menu so there is no entry point instead the VectorMain was called.
Feel free to criticise or suggest anything
